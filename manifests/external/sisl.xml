  <description brief="N-dimensional Bspline and NURBS curve and surface implementation">
  This library implements algorithms to manage B-splines and NURBS curves and
  surfaces. It is not meant to be used directly, but serves as the underlying
  implementation of the base::geometry::Spline&lt;DIM&gt; template in
  base/types.
